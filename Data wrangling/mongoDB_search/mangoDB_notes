Notes for MongoDB:

Query:

Query is a command that we send to database to find data.
By default, queries in MongoDB return all fields in matching documents.
For example:

query = {"manufacturer": "Porsche"}
autos = db.autos.find(query)

will return all page content that match the manufacturer field with Porsche.

To limit the amount of data that MongoDB sends to applications, you can include a projection document to specify or restrict fields to return.

Projection:
For example:
projection = {"_id": 0, "name": 1}
autos = db.autos.find(query,projection)

By doing so, the MongoDB will only send the projected data and in the format of 0 field as ID and 1 field as name.


Insert Documents into collections in MongoDB

for x in autos:
	db.myautos.insert(x)
